#+title: tred units

*tred* adopts a *system-of-units* ultimately based that from CLHEP.

There are two rules for the system-of-units that shall not be violated:

- Any value imported to *tred* must be converted into the system-of-units by *multiplying* by the unit for which the value is provided.

- Any value exported from *tred* may be converted to a specific unit by *dividing* by the desired unit.

As a consequence, any value used by tred is in correct units.

In general, any *numeric literal* that gives a value with units shall never be
*bare* but shall have a unit multiplied.

Some examples in Python:

#+begin_src python
  from tred.units import *

  # import
  tick = 50*ns

  # export
  print(f'the tick is {tick/us} microseconds')
#+end_src
